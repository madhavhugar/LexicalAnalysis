export default 'Lexical density is a concept in computational linguistics that measures the \
structure and complexity of human communication in a language.[1] Lexical density estimates \
the linguistic complexity in a written or spoken composition from the functional words \
(grammatical units) and content words (lexical units, lexemes). One method to calculate the \
lexical density is to compute the ratio of lexical items to the total number of words. \
Another method is to compute the ratio of lexical items to the number of higher structural \
items in a composition, such as the total number of clauses in the sentences.[2][3] The \
lexical density for an individual evolves with age, education, communication style, \
circumstances, unusual injuries or medical condition,[4] and his or her creativity. The \
inherent structure of a human language and one\'s first language may impact the lexical \
density of the individual\'s writing and speaking style. Further, human communication in \
the written form is generally more lexically dense than in the spoken form after the early \
childhood stage.[5][6] The lexical density impacts the readability of a composition and the \
ease with which the listener or reader can comprehend a communication.[7][8] The lexical \
density may also impact the memorability and retention of a sentence and the message.[9]';
